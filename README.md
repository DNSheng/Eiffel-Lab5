ToDo:

	- Double check undo and redo
		- Expand to 2 scenarios:
			- Before game undo and redo (traverse error history)
			- In game undo (traverse errors and moves)
				- Make sure not to blow past to before game start
			- Ensure that these work with multiple games in a row
				- Either from play_again or new_game

	- Make new acceptance tests
